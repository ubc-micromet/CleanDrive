# CleanDrive

A script to tidy up a drive with duplicate files in separate folders.  Eddypro can end up creating duplicate output folders that need to be cleaned up.

* It will move files from a redundant/duplicated folder to a deisred location.  e.g.:
	* From .../EP_Outputs/eddypro_binned_cospectra (1) to .../EP_Outputs/eddypro_binned_cospectra
* If a file already exists in the destination, it will skip over it and allow you to delte it at the end of the process.
